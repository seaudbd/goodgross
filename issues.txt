did u fix this note: 
For business registration need to add:
1. Reenter Email address.
2. Include for business type retail or wholesale "Both" too.
3. We need some kind of way of  verification like im not robot?
4. Can u change show password eye like in image below.


Personal registration looks fine but:
1. Can u change show password eye like in image below.
2. In my account change "Change to Business (Retail) to Change to Seller Personal (Retail)"
3. In my account Change to Business remove (Wholesale). When user decides to change account to business and clicks, options pops up asking Wholesale or Retail or Both?
